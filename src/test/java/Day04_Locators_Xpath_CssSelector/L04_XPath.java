    So far, we have learned 6 locators:
    1- By.id()
    2- By.name()
    3- By.className()
    4- By.tagName()
    5- By.linkText()
    6- By.partialLinkText()

    These locators are specialized in their respective areas.
    However, if an HTML element does not have an 'id' attribute, then By.id() cannot be used.
    Similarly, if the HTML element is not a link, By.linkText() or By.partialLinkText() cannot be used.

    What we need is a powerful LOCATOR that can identify *any* kind of element.

    XPath and CSS Selector are designed to locate any type of web element,
    making them more flexible and powerful than the basic locators.
